VillageConnect is a full-stack web application designed for rural communities, built using React, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. The app features a responsive home page displaying community services (e.g., events, resources) in a grid of styled cards, fetched from an Express REST API connected to MongoDB Atlas. Users can add services via a form, with data persisted in the database. A mobile-friendly hamburger menu enhances navigation, and a loading spinner improves UX during API calls. Tailwind CSS ensures a modern, responsive design. Future enhancements include user authentication and service editing/deletion features.
