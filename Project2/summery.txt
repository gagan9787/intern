The focus was on learning back-end development with Node.js, Express, and Git. The project goal was to simulate a shopâ€™s inventory system by building a simple services API. Tasks included setting up a server with GET and POST endpoints, testing with Postman, and handling errors for invalid requests. Git was introduced for version control, creating a repository, committing changes, and pushing code to GitHub. Finally, the front-end services page was connected to the Express API using fetch. This week established essential skills in server setup, API development, testing, and version control basics.
